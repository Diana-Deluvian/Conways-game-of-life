                <h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>
                <p>Conway's game of life is a matrix of cells with just a few simple rules that serve
                    to illustrate how even a seemingly simple set up and configuration can yield profound
                    and even impossible to predict results. It is turing complete, but this small version
                    meant only for display purposes is limited to 25x25 cells (by design it should be infinite).
                   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Further Reading.</a>
                </p>
                <ol>The rules are as follows:
                    <br>
                    <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
                    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
                    <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
                    <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>You can left click to toggle a cell between alive(black) and dead, and set up your own
                    configurations, or use one of the preselected ones below, and let the game mesmerize you. </p>
